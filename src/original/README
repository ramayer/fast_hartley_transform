This archive includes the following files
 fft_mayer.c = my fft routines
 trigtbl.h = A fast trig function generator
 time_mayer.c = a test program for my fft/ifft
 time_r_mayer.c = a test program for my real valued fft/ifft

 fft_duhamel.c = "a duhamel-holman split radix dif fft"
 time_duhamel.c = a test program the above fft

 test_mayer.c = tests the fft
 test_duhamel.c = tests the fft

 summary.sparc = results of many different ffts using gcc on a sparc
 compare_ffts = script to run time_* for a variety of sizes

 Makefile = creates the test programs

The test programs created are
 time_mayer [optional-number-of-points]
 time_duhamel [optional-number-of-points]
which should run each fft and ifft a bunch of times and display the results
and
 test_mayer
 test_duhamal
which should output the same results and confirm that both work correctly.
